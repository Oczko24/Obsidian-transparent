## Features

- **Light Color Palette**: The theme uses a soft color scheme that is easy on the eyes, perfect for long writing sessions.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Clean lines and ample white space create a serene workspace, **focusing on your content**.
- **Customizable Background**: You can add a background image by linking it in the `.css` file via base64 **or using CSS snippets**, enhancing the visual appeal of your notes. (for advanced users)
- **Integration with plugins**: Some plugins just look better with this theme due to **seamless integration**, taking them into account in the code.
- **Integration with snippets**: The theme includes built-in custom snippets, for example: [Accent everywhere](https://github.com/Oczko24/Obsidian_things/blob/main/css_snippets/Accent%20everywhere.css). You can enable them via Style Settings:)
- **Style Settings**: You can fully customize the look of this theme via [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings).

Enjoy a **beautiful** and functional writing experience with this theme!

This is a complete, plug-and-play theme that is regularly updated. To stay up to date, I recommend installing it through the Obsidian theme browser. While inspired by transparency snippets, it has been carefully refined to provide a cohesive and polished experience.

### Plugin Styling

Some plugins don't always look great by default, so this theme includes small tweaks to make them blend perfectly with the main design. **These plugins are styled to match the theme's transparency and blur effects.**

Works especially well with:

- Style Settings
- Make.md
- MySnippets
- Day Planner
- Remotely Save

You don't need to change anything – everything works out of the box.
