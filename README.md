## Features

- **Light Color Palette**: The theme uses a soft color scheme that is easy on the eyes, perfect for long writing sessions.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Clean lines and ample white space create a serene workspace, **focusing on your content**.

- **Integration with plugins**: Some plugins just look better with this theme due to **seamless integration**, taking them into account in the code.
- **Integration with snippets**: theme is made to work with my own snippets, for example; [Accent everywhere](https://github.com/Oczko24/Obsidian_things/blob/main/css_snippets/Accent%20everywhere.css)
- **Now you can change look of this theme via [style settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)**

Enjoy a **beautiful** and functional writing experience with this theme!

i recommend to install this theme via obsidian theme browser because im regulary updating this theme:)

### Plugin Styling

Some plugins don't always look great by default - so this theme includes small tweaks to make them blend perfectly with the main design. **These plugins are styled to match the theme's transparency and blur effects.**

Works especially well with:

- Style Settings
- Make.md
- MySnippets
- Day Planner
- Remotely Save

You don't need to change anything – everything works out of the box.

### Roadmap

- [x] better light theme
