## Features

- **Light Color Palette**: The theme uses a soft color scheme that is easy on the eyes.
- **Minimalistic Design**: Clean lines and ample white space create a serene workspace.
- **Customizable Background**: You can add a background image by linking it in the `.css` file via base64, enhancing the visual appeal of your notes. (for advanced users)
- **Integration with plugins**: Some plugins just look better with this theme due to taking them into account in the code.
- **Integration with snippets**: theme is made to work with my own snippets, for example; [Accent everywhere](https://github.com/Oczko24/Obsidian_things/blob/main/css_snippets/Accent%20everywhere.css)
- **Now you can change look of this theme via [style settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)**

Enjoy a **beautiful** and functional writing experience with this theme!

### Plugin Styling

Some plugins don't always look great on transparent themes - so this theme includes small tweaks to make them blend perfectly with the main design.

Works especially well with:

- Style Settings
- Make.md
- MySnippets
- Day Planner
- Remotely Save

You don't need to change anything – everything works out of the box.
